What is memprof?
================
Memprof is a memory profiler for Ruby that requires no patches to the Ruby VM.
It can help you find Ruby level memory leaks in your application.

How to use
==========

require 'memprof'
Memprof.start

# ruby code

Memprof.stats

# more ruby code

Memprof.stats
Memprof.stop


The above code will output 2 summaries, allowing you to compare which objects were
destroyed and which are still around.

Memprof.stats also takes an (optional) file name to write the output to a file.

Supported systems
=================
Currently supporting:

  Linux (enable-shared AND disable-shared):
    x86_64 builds of Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.6/1.8.7
    x86_64 builds of MRI Ruby

  Snow Leopard (enable-shared AND disable-shared):
    x86_64 builds of Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.6/1.8.7
    x86_64 builds of MRI Ruby

    Support for unstripped binaries and stripped binaries if (and only if) the
    symbol files live in /usr/lib/debug/

    You can get symbol files for system Rubies by installing -dbg packages.

    For example, on ubuntu: apt-get install libruby1.8-dbg

  Snow Leopard:
    x86_64 builds of Ruby Enterprise Edition 1.8.7
    x86_64 builds of MRI Ruby  (enable-shared and disable-shared)
    Unstripped binaries only!

Experimental (somewhat broken) support:

  Linux and OSX:
    i386/i686 support.

  Snow Leopard:
    OSX system Ruby, distributed with Snow Leopard

Coming soon:

  Official support for Ruby 1.9
